              Hello! I‚Äôm <span className="font-extrabold">Angelo</span>, a{" "}
              {years}
              -year-old guy from <span>Italy</span>, who has a lot of passions,
              especially coding.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-8">
              I have many interests and I‚Äôm trying to cultivate all of them.
              When I was younger, I thought coding was my only passion, but not
              long ago, I took a year-long break from coding to focus on my
              life.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-8">
              During this break, I found out that I‚Äôm also interested in{" "}
              <span>design</span>, particularly web design, which I am currently
              engaged in. I really love the design process; I love{" "}
              <span>things that look good and work well</span>, and I appreciate
              the hard work behind the final product we see.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-8">
              In my everyday use, I have my <span>MacBook</span>, my{" "}
              <span>iPhone</span>, and my <span>AirPods</span>, especially my
              AirPods that I can‚Äôt live without. I spend a lot of time listening
              to music.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-8">
              I don‚Äôt have extensive experience in coding, but I know{" "}
              <mark>HTML</mark>, <mark>CSS</mark>, and <mark>JavaScript</mark>{" "}
              well for vanilla web development. I also like working with{" "}
              <mark>Node.js</mark> for both frontend and backend, and I‚Äôm
              currently learning some frameworks like <mark>React</mark>. If
              you‚Äôre interested in my projects, feel free to check them out{" "}
